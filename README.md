# Quality Engineering Case Study: Bonding Failure in Catheter Assembly Line

## Overview

This project investigates a spike in bonding failures on a catheter assembly production line. Using core quality tools like Pareto Analysis, 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, FMEA, and a p-Chart, I identified root causes and proposed corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).

## Problem Statement

Bonding failures increased from 2% to 6% over two weeks, contributing to 41% of total defects and reducing yield from 98% to 91%.

---

##  Root Cause Analysis

- **5 Whys** identified inconsistent curing times due to lack of SOP and operator training.
- **Fishbone diagram** mapped broader contributing factors: method, machine, material, manpower, measurement, and environment.

---

## FMEA Findings

- Highest RPN: **240** for “Inconsistent curing time”
- Priority action: Create standard UV curing SOP and retrain operators

---

## Control Chart Results

- **Tool Used**: p-Chart (proportion-based chart with variable sample sizes)
- One point (June 10) outside UCL → **Special cause variation**
- Justification: Sample sizes varied from 81 to 119; p-chart adjusts control limits accordingly

---

##  CAPA Summary

### Corrective Actions:
- Create a detailed SOP for UV curing
- Replace UV lamps; add calibration checks
- Perform 100% inspection for 1 week

### Preventive Actions:
- Conduct structured training with sign-off
- Implement FIFO tracking for adhesive
- Weekly review using p-charts

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Pareto & Root Cause Analysis
- Control Charts (p-chart)
- FMEA risk prioritization
- CAPA implementation planning
- Report writing for quality investigations
