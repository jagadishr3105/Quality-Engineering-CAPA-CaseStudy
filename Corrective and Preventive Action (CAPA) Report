## 1. Problem Statement

Over the past two weeks, the bonding failure rate on Catheter Assembly Line A increased from 2% to approximately 6%, resulting in a drop in production yield from 98% to 91%.  
This issue represented over 40% of total recorded defects and posed a significant risk to product quality and throughput.

---

## 2. Investigation Summary

The issue was analyzed using structured quality engineering tools:

- Pareto Analysis identified bonding failure as the top defect (41%).
- 5 Whys revealed inconsistent UV curing as the root cause, due to lack of a standardized SOP.
- Fishbone diagram categorized contributing factors under Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, and Environment.
- FMEA assigned the highest RPN (240) to the inconsistent curing process.
- p-Chart revealed process instability on one date (June 10), indicating special cause variation.

## 3. Root Cause

The root cause of the bonding failure was the absence of a standardized curing procedure in the SOP, leading to operator-dependent variation in UV exposure time and technique.  
Contributing factors included aging equipment, lack of visual curing indicators, and insufficient operator training.

---

## 4. Risk Assessment (FMEA)

The FMEA assigned:
- Severity = 8  
- Occurrence = 6  
- Detection = 5  

This resulted in a Risk Priority Number (RPN) of 240, indicating a high-priority issue requiring immediate corrective and preventive actions.

## 5. Control Chart Analysis (p-Chart)

The process was monitored over a 30-day period using a p-chart. One data point on June 10 exceeded the Upper Control Limit (UCL), indicating a statistically out-of-control condition.  
This supports the conclusion that a special cause — likely tied to operator error or equipment malfunction — was present on that date.

---

## 6. Corrective Actions (CA)

1. Develop and implement a detailed SOP for UV curing, specifying curing time, distance, and lamp specifications.  
2. Replace aging UV curing lamps and introduce calibration verification routines.  
3. Conduct 100% inspection for bonding integrity on all parts for one week.

---

## 7. Preventive Actions (PA)

1. Create a structured operator training program with sign-off tracking.  
2. Implement a FIFO tracking system for adhesive inventory control.  
3. Perform weekly bonding defect trend analysis using p-charts to ensure ongoing process stability.

---

## 8. Outcome and Follow-Up

Corrective and preventive actions are expected to reduce bonding failures and return the process to statistical control.  
Effectiveness will be monitored through updated control charts and routine audits over the next 30 days.
